        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <!-- Step 1: Setting Your Yearly Goals -->
            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Set Your Yearly Goals</h3>
                <p><strong>Start with the Big Picture:</strong> Begin by defining what you want to achieve by the end of the year. These are your major objectives, such as running a marathon, launching a new product, or learning a new language.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> Use the platform's Yearly Goal feature to input these goals. You can add detailed descriptions, set deadlines, and prioritize your goals. This helps you stay focused on what matters most throughout the year.</p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Setting clear yearly goals provides direction and a sense of purpose. It gives you a roadmap for the year and helps you stay motivated over the long term.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Step 2: Breaking Down into Monthly Milestones -->
            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Break Down into Monthly Milestones</h3>
                <p><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Take your yearly goals and break them down into smaller, manageable monthly milestones. These are the building blocks that will help you progress steadily toward your yearly goals.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> In the Monthly Goal section, outline specific milestones for each month. For example, if your yearly goal is to run a marathon, your milestone for month six might be to complete a half marathon.</p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Monthly milestones keep you on track and allow you to celebrate incremental progress. They prevent you from feeling overwhelmed by your larger goals and help maintain momentum.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Step 3: Planning Your Weekly Targets -->
            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Plan Your Weekly Targets</h3>
                <p><strong>Focus on Weekly Achievements:</strong> Each week, set specific targets that contribute to your monthly milestones. Weekly targets are actionable steps that ensure consistent progress.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> Use the Weekly Goal feature to plan out your week. For example, if you're training for a marathon, you might set a target to increase your long run by one mile each week.</p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Weekly targets keep you focused and allow you to adjust your plans as needed. They help you manage your time effectively and ensure that you're making steady progress toward your goals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Step 4: Taking Daily Actions -->
            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Take Daily Actions</h3>
                <p><strong>Make It a Daily Habit:</strong> Daily actions are the small steps you take every day to reach your weekly targets. Consistency is key, and daily actions help build habits that lead to success.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> The Daily Task feature allows you to schedule and track your daily actions. Whether it's a 30-minute yoga session, a short run, or reviewing your business strategy, daily actions keep you moving forward.</p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Daily actions are the foundation of your success. They ensure that you're consistently working toward your goals and help you stay motivated by seeing daily progress.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Step 5: Tracking Your Progress -->
            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Track Your Progress</h3>
                <p><strong>Monitor and Adjust:</strong> As you work toward your goals, the platform provides real-time updates on your progress. You can see how each daily action contributes to your weekly targets, how weekly targets lead to monthly milestones, and how these milestones bring you closer to your yearly goals.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> Use the interactive dashboard to track your progress. The platform offers progress bars, charts, and visual indicators to show how you're doing. You can also adjust your goals and targets based on your progress.</p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Tracking your progress helps you stay on course and make informed decisions about your goals. It provides motivation by showing how far you've come and what you need to do to stay on track.</p>
